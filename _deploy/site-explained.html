<p>In case your are wondering; No, this site has nothing to do with headaches. It simply is a metaphor for life. If life as described in this weblog was a migraine and each entry was a throb in that migraine, then you should understand the main navigation. With the help of the titles you should be able to discern that you will find the things that make it all worthwhile under 'meds'. There I plan to expound on the things that serve as a release for the pressures of life. I imagine that section would include, for the most part, my latest mountain biking adventures and photos, etc.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that none of the links are working. I am very aware of this and have simply not got that far. Be patient, please. I have not made any final decisions on the design yet either and do not expect to keep this color scheme. I hope to use the general layout but all things are subject to change. I have not even started on a cms so I am currently editing this page manually for each post. In fact, I am not sure if I want to take another crack at creating my own half baked, yet much simpler cms or if I want to used a premade, albeit unnecessarily complicated one. Decisions, decisions, decisions.</p>
<p>When I finally get this front page done, I will work on my about page (colophon). There I will explain things in for detail and maybe someday work up a breakdown of this site's code. That, most likely, will happen only after I finalize the design. Feel free to check back often and watch this site progress while live.</p>
