<p>Earlier today I received an email that someone named 'xilviu' had just posted to a thread of mine over at the <a href='http://forums.devshed.com/'>DevShed Forum</a>. Wow! I haven't even visited that site in years. Out of curiosity, I clicked the link to the thread to see what was up.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the reply by 'xilviu' did not exist. I laster found that he had posted a <a href='http://forums.devshed.com/t280270/s.html'>new thread</a> which asked the same question and stated he could not find the answer in older threads. Then the first solution he was offered would time out. Well yeah, thats why I didn't try it that way myself. But I digress.</p>
<p>Back in April, 2003 someone had asked for a way to calculate the number of weekdays (excluding weekends) between any two dates. After some clarification of what he wanted, I came up with a <a href='http://forums.devshed.com/showpost.php?p=254721&postcount=7'>function</a> that did just what he wanted. Hmm, not bad. I remember writing that. Although I would do a few things a little different today, that code looks pretty good. Certainly something worth pointing to, to highlight my coding abilities.</p>
<p>That was probably when I was at the peek (the sharpest) in my PHP coding abilities. I would spend a few hours almost every day browsing the forum looking for questions to answer and people to help. I hardly ever asked a question. That is basically how I learned to program. At first I just read the problems and solutions that others had, then as I got more comfortable with what I was doing, I began to answer some of the more simple questions. As time went by, I started answering more and more difficult questions and even providing people with various little code snippets.</p>
<p>According to my <a href='http://forums.devshed.com/member.php?s=2dd43280a03abd41aba7a4b9b13a40d5&u=20031'>profile</a>, I was an active member for a little over two years, from December 4<sup>th</sup>, 2002 to March 4<sup>th</sup>, 2004. (Hey, whats up with both dates being on the 4<sup>th</sup>? Weird.) One could see my progression, and occasional regression by reviewing <a href='http://forums.devshed.com/search.php?do=finduser&u=20031'>all my posts</a>. Interestingly, of the 207 posts I made within that two year period, I only <a href='http://forums.devshed.com/search.php?searchid=967839'>started 6 threads</a>. Of those six, only two were in the PHP forum and only one was a question. Guess I can figure stuff out on my own.</p>
<p>Which begs the question: Why can't I figure out the answer to the <a href='http://wordpress.org/support/topic/38479'>question I recently posted</a> on the <a href='wordpress.org'>Wordpress</a> Forum? And why has no one offered an answer? Maybe the problem is that it is imposable to do what I'm trying, which occurred to me when I asked, but then someone who is in the know should state as much so the issue can be closed and I can move on to other things. Is that too much to ask?</p>
