<p>Some time ago I released my <a href="http://achinghead.com/archives/67/adding-wikilinks-to-markdown-in-python/">first stab</a> at an extension for <a href="http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/">Python-Markdown</a>. As I said then, I didn't really have any use for it, but it did give me a chance to play with Markdown. To continue that exercise and better understand how best to create extensions for Markdown, I made some improvements to the extension.</p>
<p>The most obvious problem with my first try was that if one wanted to use the extension with other extensions (in other words; not just calling the provided wrapper function), then the regex would need to be redefined. That is not ideal. After looking at the footnote extension (included with markdown) I realized I needed to define a class which registered the extension. Then one could just create an instance of that class and continue. Brilliant!</p>
<p>To view the new code and see how it all works, I'll point you to the <a href="http://achinghead.com/markdown/wikilink/">new page</a> I created just for the extension. Any additional updates will be made there. And for those that may be interested, I'll announce any major updates here, although I don't anticipate many. That being said, A new and improved way of including extensions was recently <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=29904824&amp;forum_id=48941">announced</a> on the mailing list. I suppose I'll be playing with that soon.</p>
