<p>Saturday was sunny and 35-40, Sunday was rainy and 40-45 and I spent almost the entire weekend under my car. (Thus, no posts here). To top it all off, I only got it half fixed. I am currently driving around without a muffler. Although I will say that the car is considerably quieter since I plugged the hole before the catalytic converter and I am no longer getting fumes in the cabin. Even so, I have been driving rather slow, shifting early to keep the rmp's down, coasting past police cars with the clutch in, and so on. I initially thought I would take yesterday (Monday) afternoon off to finish the repair job. However, my father thought he could get the 'right' part for the job at a store not to far from his job. Which, I might add, is in the opposite direction of mine. So I decided to postpone the work until this afternoon when I would have the part available.</p>
<p>There are 2 problems with that plan. First, my father worked so late that the store closed hours before he got out, so I still don't have the part. Of course, I could still stop at the local auto parts store and buy a few various pipes and adapters to clamp together; so that is not an insurmountable problem. But, when we add that to the second problem, I&#8217;d rather stay at work. (Hmm, Have I ever said that before and meant it?). You see, while yesterday was a beautiful, sunny, albeit cool and windy day, today is a different story. This morning I woke up to some 6-8 inches of snow and it has snowed continuously all morning. I have no desire to drive home in this storm and crawl under my car. Did I mention, I do NOT have a garage?</p>
<p>What a week, and its not even half over!</p>
