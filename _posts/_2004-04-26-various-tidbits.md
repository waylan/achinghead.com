Wow, that was quite a bit. Enjoy!

<h3 id='treo'>Hoping for a Treo 610</h3>

I know I already posted a link to this in my 'of interest' sidebar, but I felt the need to expound. <a href='http://verizon.com'>Verizon</a>, are you listening?

Ever since the <a href='http://www.handspring.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml'>Treo 600</a> launched I have wanted one. A phone and PDA in one nice small package. Reading <a href='http://www.pdabuyersguide.com/treo_600.htm'>review</a>s has only confirmed my desire. I would consider this a perfect fit. You see, I dislike having bulging pockets and utility belts to lug around all hours of the day. For that reason, more than any other, I have never seriously looked at purchasing a PDA. I find even the smallest of cell phones cumbersome enough. To think that I would need to carry two such devices has absolutely no appeal.

When the <a href='http://www.sharpusa.com/products/TypeLandingD/0,2113,203,00.html'>Sharp Zuarus</a> came out a few years ago, I was intrigued. My other reservation about PDAs was data entry. I want a keyboard, and not those cumbersome numeric keyboards on most cell phones. Still, the Zuarus was lacking in a few areas and, besides being a little too big, would not replace my cell phone.

I have also been intrigued by <a href='http://www.bluetooth.com'>Bluetooth</a> for some time (<a href='http://a.wholelottanothing.org/features.blah/entry/007805'>See why</a>). The problem is, the only <a href='http://verizonwireless.com' title="Verizon Wireless">wireless carrier</a> that provides decent coverage in my area currently does not offer any phones that are Bluetooth enabled. As I am ready to upgrade my phone, this has left me in a quandary about which phone to get, as none of the available models really fits what I want.

And then, this morning, while checking various RSS feeds I subscribe to, I find this exciting title at <a href='http://mobile9.com'>mobile9.com</a>: <a href='http://www.mobile9.com/news/2004/04/treo_610_to_be_launched_on_verizon.php'>Treo 610 to be launched on Verizon</a>. Verizon, I am begging you to keep this promise. I will buy one the first day they are available. (So that's what I'm using my tax return for.)

<h3 id='logs'>Reviewing my Log files</h3>

I have my server log files emailed to me every week. As this site is fairly new and doesn't get much traffic, they are usually rather small and I can easily detect problems by scanning them with my own two eyes. Earlier today, as I was looking through them I noted that they are starting to get a little long for that. It may be time to start using some scripts to break things down.

For instance, I noted a few 'File Not Found' errors that appear to be from broken or misspelled links on my site. Problem is, I am having trouble singling them out now because the log is so long. I never had that problem before. While it sounds bad, I think maybe this is a good thing; it means I am getting more visitors.

Of more concern was the fact that a few attempts where made to access any .htaccess files that may be present. Fortunately, 'access denied' errors were returned. I guess this drives home the point that one can never be too careful with file permissions.

On a more positive note, I'm beginning to see referrals from some interesting sites. (Although I suspect they are all coming from comments I have left at those sites.)

<h3 id='calvin'>Calvin's Return?</h3>

Is <a href='http://meyerweb.com'>Eric</a> <a href='http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/200404.html#d13t1143'>on to something</a> or is this just wishful thinking? I'm leaning toward the later while hoping for the former.

<h3 id='silverorange'>Silverorange reviews</h3>

I can't say for certain, but I think it was <a href='http://gizmodo.com'>gizmodo</a> (great site) that turned me on to <a href='http://stuff.silverorange.com'>silverorange stuff</a>. These guys only write reviews for stuff that they have actually bought and use regularly, not just for the sake of writing reviews. While they may not cover all the available products in a category, their comments seem to indicate that they research thoroughly before purchasing and wait to write their review after using the product long enough (up to three years by my count) to formulate an accurate opinion. While some of the reviews may seem a little outdated in this fast paced and ever changing market, I still like their approach. Maybe I should write a few reviews of my own.

<h3 id='rss'>RSS frustration</h3>

It seems that I am <a href='http://allinthehead.com/retro/198/'>not the only one</a> bothered by RSS feeds that indicate the site has been updated when only a few new visitors' comments have been added. On top of that, Wordpress, by default, always shows its feeds as updated. I find this extremely annoying. I only want to actually view the feed if a new article has been posted that I have not read. Fortunately, after perusing the source code, I found a few lines of commented out code that solves this vary problem. Consider <a href='http://achinghead.com/throb/wp-rss2.php'>my RSS feed</a> fixed. If you want to know if more comments have been posted, subscribe to the comments feed. That is what it is there for.

<h3 id='sparse'>Sparse posts</h3>

I haven't posted here in a few weeks. A few varying issues have contributed to this problem. Time and what I consider a worthy post.

Time is a no-brainer. Who isn't short on time? Simply put, I just haven't had enough time to type my thoughts on various subjects. Guess I'll need to find more of that stuff somewhere. Know where I can get some?

The other problem though, is only compounded by the first one. I have the preconceived notion that every post should be rather lengthy. If I don't have the time to sit down and type up at least three or four paragraphs on a subject, then I won't post anything. Maybe I should take a lesson from <a href='http://kottke.org'>kottke.org</a> or <a href='http://www.37signals.com/svn/'>SIGNAL VS. NOISE</a>, both of which often post single paragraphs or even the occasional single sentence. (I think I succeeded with "<a href='#calvin'>Calvin's Return?</a>" above - but not anything else here).

Which brings me to the question:

<h3 id='focus'>Should I change my focus?</h3>

You may, or may not, have noticed that I post links with short comments in the 'of interest' sidebar nearly every day. I do so because these only take a minute or two. However, I have noticed, on occasion, that the limitations of these comments imposed by my CMS have left me wanting for more. I wonder: Should I make this the main weblog and have a 'featured article of the week' off to the side? Something like the newly redesigned <a href='http://forevergeek.com'>Forever_Geek</a>? Tell me, what do you think?
