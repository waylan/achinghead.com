title: "the site's back up"
author: Waylan Limberg

summary: "Finally! Unfortunately, my host's server's crashed while I was just starting a redesign of the site and they lost everything. Apparently, they don't do backups because I don't pay extra for that service and I can't complain because it was all in the fine print when I signed up. Oh well. It's my own fault I didn't back things up myself. Actually I did back up the html, php and image files but not the database, so I lost all my content. In other words all I still have is the stuff I was reworking anyway. Just another throb in the migraine of life. ;)"
