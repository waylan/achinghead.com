Dan Cederholm recently <a href='http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2005/02/28/typecast.html' title="Tyecast">asked how we type</a>: ten finger 0r hunt and peck? I answered with <a href='http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2005/02/28/typecast.html#comment29' title="Comment #29">this comment</a>. Now you should understand all the typo's and spelling errors in this here site. Hopefully, some soon to come upgrades (hint, hint) will help in that regard. Well, I'm off to lunch, so that's all for today.
