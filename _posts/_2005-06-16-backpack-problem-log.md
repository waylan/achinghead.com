When 37Signals released <a href='backpackit.com'>Backpack</a>, I signed up for a free account to give it a spin. Unfortunately, nothing worked as advertised. Although they have ironed out all the problems (as far as I can tell), I am assuming many of them were caused at least in part by the firewall I'm behind here at work. Every problem seems to involve the use of ajax and in each case, the resulting problem was slightly different.

Fortunately, the Notes feature worked well enough that I could still use it, even if I had to manually reload after each edit. That being the case, I documented each problem I found and when I first noticed any change in behavior. I have since <a href='http://waylan.backpackit.com/pub/127974'>made that page public</a>. Just thought I'd share. Enjoy!
