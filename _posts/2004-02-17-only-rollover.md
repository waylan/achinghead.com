summary: "Apparently my <a href='inlinedropdown-unstyled.html' title=\"Inline Dropdown Menu &#45; Unstyled\">inline dropdown menu</a> is not as original of an idea as I once thought. I came a cross <a href='http://www.9rules.com/whitespace/css_focus/absolute_and_relative_positioning.php'>this</a> today, which linked to <a href='http://www.kalsey.com/tools/csstabs/index.php?section=2'>this</a>. even so, mine is the only one where the submenu appears on rollover. Ha! So there!  Or is that maybe a usability issue thing? I suppose by having the sub-menu not visible, I could be making it inaccessible to some who don't have the ability to hover. Hmmm.  To be honest, one of the reasons I never developed a better looking version was because I couldn't get it to look right unless I did away with the fancy rollover stuff. I guess it just goes to show that there is no such thing as an original idea. Man, this manual editing just to add a post is getting to be a real pain."
