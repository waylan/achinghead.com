summary: "Figures, someone else has beaten me to another one of my <a href='http://achinghead.com/throb/index.php?p=13' title=\"Geek Projects\">farfetched ideas</a>. Let me explain. I have been repairing my own bikes for years. I have never really needed to take my bike to the shop. However, I always wanted to do more. Wouldn't it be cool to build my own bike? Absolutely!! As I considered the possibilities I never really saw myself producing the run of the mill mountain bikes of today. Instead, I always saw myself custom designing chopper bikes. The '<a href='http://www.westcoastchoppers.com/jessebio.html' title=\"Jesse James bio\">Jesse James</a> of bicycles', if you will. I've had in mind something along the lines of a cross between the old Schwinn Sting-Rays (minus the banana seat) and cruiser bikes. I can just picture myself tooling around town; sitting back, arms and legs outstretched... [fade to fuzzy dreamlike state]"

Figures, someone else has beaten me to another one of my <a href='http://achinghead.com/throb/index.php?p=13' title="Geek Projects">farfetched ideas</a>. Let me explain. I have been repairing my own bikes for years. I have never really needed to take my bike to the shop. However, I always wanted to do more. Wouldn't it be cool to build my own bike? Absolutely!! As I considered the possibilities I never really saw myself producing the run of the mill mountain bikes of today. Instead, I always saw myself custom designing chopper bikes.

Then, <a href='http://www.gizmodo.com/' title="The Gadgets Weblog">Gizmod</a> <a href='http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/schwinn_stingray_redux_014732.php' title="Schwinn Sting-Ray Redux">informs me</a> that <a href='http://www.schwinnbike.com/' title="Schwinn Bikes">Schwinn</a> is <a href='http://www.schwinnstingray.com/' title="The rebirth of cool has arrived">bringing the Sting-Ray back</a> and asks: "who will it appeal to?" The answer to that question would be: Me! Or would it? After a little research I find that it is only available as a 20" kids bike. A little large for my 6'4", 200+lbs. frame. Even so, it's available for a measly <a href='http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.gsp?product_id=2603637&cat=61889&type=5&dept=4171&path=0%3A4171%3A61903%3A61904%3A4182%3A61889' title="Walmart.com">$180</a> at a popular department store near you. The perfect gift for some kid, I'm sure.

Even so, I wasn't going to let that hamper my enthusiasm. In further searching I found a <a href='http://www.dicksbikeshop.com/Main.htm' title="Dick's Bike Shop">Schwinn dealer</a> no more than an hour and a half drive from here that has a <a href='http://www.dicksbikeshop.com/krate.htm' title="Krate Bikes">collection of Krate bikes</a> (a popular Sting-Ray model) and even some <a href='http://www.dicksbikeshop.com/low_riders.htm' title="low riders">custom low riders</a>. While the low riders pictured are not exactly what I had in mind, I like the concept and will have to check them out someday.

So, I guess there is room for my ideas after all. Now, to find the time and money to attend <a href='http://www.bikeschool.com/frame.htm' title="United Bicycle Institute">bicycle frame building school</a>. Ok, maybe not. But I can dream!
