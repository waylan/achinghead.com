That's about right. I like to think I keep up on speaking correctly (for an American) most of the time accounting for the 70%. Growing up and living in rular New York State accounts for the Yankee and the Upper Midwestern/Midwestern comes from being just outside of Buffalo. Go any far east (Rochester) in the state and a few things change (like the pop/soda thing - actually I try to say 'soda' but 'pop' is so ingrained and used by all my friends I answered 'pop' in the quiz). Of course, what I'm really excited about is the big Zero for Dixie. Anything but would have hurt (must be the Yankee in me coming out).
