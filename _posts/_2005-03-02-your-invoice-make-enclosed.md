<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Haughey' title="Matthew Haughey - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Matthew Haughey</a> isn't the only one <a href='http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2005/03/the_elusive_mak.html' title="A Whole Lotta Nothing: The elusive Make">having trouble subscribing</a> to <a href='http://make.oreilly.com/' title="MakeZine.com">Make</a>. Back on February 4<sup>th</sup> I received their newsletter via email telling me I could now subscribe to their magazine. I didn't jump that day, but as I read a few reviews from people who got preview issues over the next couple days and even read the partial articles available on their site, I wanted my copy too. So I tried to subscribe. For whatever reason, the credit card transaction didn't go through and I found myself in the same place as Matt.

Finally, today (March 2<sup>nd</sup> - <strong>almost one month later</strong>) I received the following email:

<blockquote><p>Dear WAYLAN LIMBERG,</p>

I'm not sure if I should just try to order online with my card again, or use a different means. I'll let you know how it all turns out.

<h3>Update (March 7 - 4:30 pm)</h3>

I just made an online payment and it went through no problem. I even got the confirmation email within a minute. Whatever the problem was before, they fixed it. I'll try to remember to let you all (the whole 1 or 2 of you) know when I get my first issue and if there are any more problems. While things are looking good right now, you think they would have made sure the process worked right from the outset; especially considering they are a new publication and need every subscription they can get.
