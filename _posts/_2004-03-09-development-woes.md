summary: "Ouch! I just checked this site in IE. I thought I had done so after the initial layout and it all looked ok. Either I only thought about it but never actually did so, or I changed something since then. Either way, <del>the layout breaks in IE.</del> And to think that was the part of this design I was least likely to change as the design evolved. Oh well. It is probably just as well. As it currently stands, the content comes after all the links and other such clutter on the sidebar in the markup. That really should be switched around so that the content comes first. This is, after all, supposed to be an accessible site. I guess I won&#39;t be finalizing the <a href='http://wordpress.org/' title=\"A state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art semantic personal publishing platform with a focus on aesthetics, web standards, and usability.\">Wordpress</a> template tonight as planned.  On another note&#58; the more observant reader may have noticed that the links in &#39;of interest&#39; on the side bar are updated more frequently that my weblog entries. You can follow these every day and follow some of my daily browsing if you so desire. I think I found a workable solution for these in Wordpress, so once that is up and running (I pretty much decided I am going with it) you should find even more. Now to find a way to date the entries (I&#39;m listing them as links under separate category in Wordpress, rather than a separate weblog) and decide how to indicate where I came across the link. After all (I seem to like that phrase today), credit belongs where credit is due."
