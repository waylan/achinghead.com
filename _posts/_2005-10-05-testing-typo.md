I haven't had much to say here lately as you may have noticed. While I could try to give various excuses about how my life is too busy with other things, I won't. Instead, I'll tell you where my blogging time has gone.

I have recently started a new blog dealing specifically with my new car. <a href="http://limberg.name/nice-n-maximized/" title="Documenting my 93 Nissan Maxima GXE">Nice-N-Maximized</a>. Bet you can't guess what kind of car I bought. Seriously though, the site has a duel purpose. <a href="http://www.asmallorange.com/" title="A Small Orange">My host</a> (highly recommended) recently enabled <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" title="Ruby on Rails">RoR</a> and I wanted to try out <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/">Typo</a>. In addition, I was about to purchase a new car, which I badly needed (but that's another story) and figured it wouldn't hurt to use a blog to document my experiences with it.

So, basically, I've been spending what little time I have playing with Typo and posting to that blog. Any other free time has been spend getting that new car into the condition I want it. You can read all about there.
