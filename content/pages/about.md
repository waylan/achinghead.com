title: About


The Person
----------

I, Waylan Limberg, was born in 1976 to hippie parents in the rural southwestern
corner of New York State, USA (approximately a 1.5 hour drive south of Buffalo).
By the time I reached the first grade, my parents had all but left behind the
hippie life style, but its fun to tell people anyway. I currently live with my
wonderful wife Kori, in Warren, Pennsylvania, USA. My interests include, in no
particular order, coding (particularly in Python), woodworking, electronics and
all things related to bicycles. My day-job has little to no relation to my
interests or anything on this site and will go unmentioned, although you may be
able to figure it out if you search the archives.

The Site
--------

As I once explained...

Of course, I abandoned that idea shortly after getting a working site. Although,
that was my first website and foray into PHP. It still amazes me it even worked.
Later I moved from my homegrown code to WordPress, dabbled with Typo (Ruby on
Rails) and finally built something I liked on the Django framework and Python.
Later, I rebuilt the site using a python script to generate flat files served
from a basic static server. Mostly recently, I migrated to the Pelican static
site generator. You can browse (and clone) the source Markdown files from
