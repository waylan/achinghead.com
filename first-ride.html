<p>I went on my first ride of the year yesterday - er we tried.  The snow has slowly been melting over this past week and the grass has begun to show through in spots. My brother and I decided that the fire roads would be best as any off road trails would be too wet and/or snowy. Boy, was that an understatement! You see, when we got up to the end of the access road we found some 2 feet of snow up in the hills. As the snowmobiles had packed it down pretty good we figured we'd give it a shot. Well, 40&#43; degrees for 4 or 5 days in a row had softened the show just a little too much. We were able to go down hill easily enough (it was a little slow with all the resistance from the softer snow) but just sat still, spinning when trying to go up even the slightest incline. With my wider tires, and better balance ;) I was able to go about 20 feet before hitting a small knoll. My brother, on the other hand, got nowhere fast. We had to walk our bikes back up while snowmobilers whizzed by giving us strange looks. I then rode down the muddy access rode, wishing I had mudguards, while my brother followed in the truck, laughing. Sorry, no pics. I still need to buy a good camera.</p>
<p>On a positive note, we did determine that switching out our <a href='http://www.ski-bike.org/' title="American Ski-Bike Association">wheels for skis</a> would be the ultimate ride. We have a certain friend, who's father often finds old discarded skis near the local ski resort. With a little <a href='http://www.dirtragmag.com/articles/article.php?ID=606&category=web_only' title="How to Make a Ski Bike">rigging</a> we should be set to go. I can&#39;t wait to try it.</p>
