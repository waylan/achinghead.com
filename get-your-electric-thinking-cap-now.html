<p>I got a real kick out of the Wired article entitled <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,65620,00.html">Apply Current, Boost Brain Power</a>. According to the article: <blockquote>Sending a weak electrical impulse through the front of a person's head can boost verbal skills by as much as 20 percent, according to a new study by the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.</blockquote></p>
<p>The article goes on to explain how similar treatments have been used in the past and how this is different. It all seemed rather appropriate today as I have quite a headache. They've been doing some remodeling in the building here at work and today they are varnishing some new doors down the hall. The fumes are rather powerful and starting to get to me. Anything to releave a headache sounds real good about now, which is one of the uses mentioned.</p>
<p>Don't know why I liked the article so much, except for how it finishes with some references to the possibility of a electric thinking cap. I always found the thinking cap metaphor kind of foolish. Shouldn't one be of that mindset at all times? Why would one choose not to think clearly at times? This, of course, adds a whole new dimension. To bad such a product will likely never be available to the general public if it's ever made at all.</p>
<p>Even so, wouldn't it be fun? Get asked a hard question and slap you old hat on to figure out the answer. Games, IQ tests and the like would ban all hats from participants. Certain types of employers would start allowing hats in the workplace (where they are currently viewed as unacceptable) and possibly even hand them out to their employees to get that edge on the competition. New games and/or reality shows (I hope not) could be developed where each participant is given a 'thinking cap' customized for there IQ level thereby equalizing all the contestant's thinking abilities. Suddenly, previous life experiences and knowledge are the only things people have to come out on top. Ok, on second thought, it could potentially make life more dull, but it's still fun to think about.</p>
<p>Wow, I think the fumes are getting to me!</p>
