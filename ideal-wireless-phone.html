<p>In this weeks Watch this Wednesday column over at Engadget, they highlight the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/2126803823512213/">The Samsung GPRS Class 10 Watch Phone</a> and ask why Samsung keeps promising such wristwatch type phone and then failing to deliver. I'd like to chime in as well. Although I did notice that the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/PressCenter/PressRelease/TelecommunicationNews/TelecommunicationNews_20030313_0000004250.htm#">press release</a> only promised the phone in Europe.</p>
<p>In any event, the concept hit me as really ideal. Especially considering it would have Bluetooth. That would eliminate the need for bulky speakers like the older various dipicted. An unobtrusive earpeace connected wirelessly via Bluetooth should do the trick. Just using it as a phone? Then thats all you need. Want some smartphone features, add a full fledged PDA and again, connect via Bluetooth. Non of those trimmed down screens and feature sets of many of the so-called smart phones. Or, pair with your notebook for seamless wireless browsing wherever you get signal (most likely more places that WIFI). True, you loose the convenience of a single device, but gain flexibility. Besides, you already wear a watch anyway, don't you? Why not have it serve a more useful purpose and eliminate one other device you have to cart around everywhere you go.</p>
<p>There is one potential problem I foresee with this setup. Remember how hot your cellphone gets after talking for a few minutes. I wouldn't exactly want anything that hot strapped to my wrist. That, and battery life can't be that great in such a small package. Perhaps that is why Samsung keeps stalling.</p>
